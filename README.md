# Abalone Analysis

Abalone analysis using pandas and other tools


In this project, I showed the basics of working with Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn and other libraries for dataset processing and analysis.

The work consists of three stages:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data analysis
3. Data visualization


First of all, we need to deal with the dataset. This dataset describes molluscs of the Abalone species. We are interested in the fact that this dataset contains categorical, real and integer data. You can read more about the data and arguments of the dataset in the abalone_attr.txt file or at the dataset website. You can find the dataset this at this link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone

1. Data cleaning
Since we need to clean the dataset from missing data, but this dataset does not have any, we can artificially create them.
After generating missing data, we can perform several methods to clean the dataset. These methods are in the code file.

2. Data analysis
For data analysis, we used normalization, standardization, One Hot Encoding, Pearson and Spearman coefficients. After data processing, the dataset is ready for more detailed study and creation of various models based on it.

3. Data visualization
I used only a few visualization examples, such as a histogram of values on 10 segments of one of the arguments or the dependence of one argument on another. Also created a visualization of the dependence of each argument on others.

I have finished the basic analysis of the dataset and now it is ready for further manipulations with it.
